New project's revenue calculator and its payback period calculation

To determine how to calculate payback period in practice, you simply divide the initial cash outlay of a project by the amount of net cash inflow that the project generates each year. For the purposes of calculating the payback period formula, you can assume that the net cash inflow is the same each year.

The payback period is expressed in years and fractions of years. For example, if a company invests $300,000 in a new production line, and the production line then produces positive cash flow of $100,000 per year, then the payback period is 3.0 years ($300,000 initial investment รท $100,000 annual payback).
